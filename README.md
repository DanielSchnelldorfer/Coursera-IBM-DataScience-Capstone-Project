# Coursera-IBM-DataScience-Capstone-Project
Capstone Project for IBM DataScience Specialization on Coursera

The aim of this capstone project was using the Foursquare API and location data in order to solve a particular business problem. This project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.

Please note: If you may want to try reproducing the code by yourself, you may get different results. That's because the tables on wikipedia as well as the location data change over time.

The code shown in the Jupyter notebook was written by myself. Only a few lines for using the Foursquare API were provided by the course instructors and are marked in the comments.
